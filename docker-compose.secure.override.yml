# VSys Next - Security Override for Windows Staging
#
# This override removes PostgreSQL port exposure for security.
# Use this with standard ports when you want port 3000 for the API
# but do NOT want PostgreSQL exposed to the network.
#
# SECURITY: PostgreSQL is NOT exposed - only accessible within Docker network.
#
# USAGE (Standard Port, Secure):
# docker compose -f docker-compose.local-staging.yml -f docker-compose.secure.override.yml up -d --build
#
# PORTS:
# - API: 3000 (standard)
# - PostgreSQL: NOT EXPOSED (internal Docker network only)

services:
  postgres:
    # Remove port exposure - database accessible only within Docker network
    ports: !reset []
